%% Remarks

Combustor_problem.pdf       % Reference paper, I'd like to get the same results

RSmith_Thesis_Final.pdf     % An MSc Thesis version of the reference paper: More explanations, more details on the problem setting and modeling choices. Unfortunately, the guy solve the system using a GEMS (which is to their group what JOE is for us I guess). So no useful indication about the method. 

Combustor geometry.pdf      % Excerpt from the RSmith thesis that shows you the mesh

euler_notes.pdf             % A good paper to read if you're not familiar with the Euler equations

Multiphase_formulation.pdf  % Provides some foundation for solving multiphase flows (Euler) - I use it
